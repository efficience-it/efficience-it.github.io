## 📘 About this project

This repository contains the **quiz application (HTML/JS/CSS)** used to practice with community-made multiple-choice questions for various **technical certifications**.

It is designed as a **training and self-assessment tool**, not an official exam simulator.  
The **question banks (YAML files)** are maintained in a **separate repository** and are loaded dynamically by this app.

The goal is to help candidates:

- Practice interactively with realistic MCQs.
- Train by domain, subtopic, or in mixed mode.
- Track their progress and identify knowledge gaps.

## 🧩 What's inside

- ✅ Frontend-only app (HTML, JavaScript, CSS)
- ✅ Loads **YAML-based question banks** from an external repository
- ✅ Organized by **certification domains & subtopics**
- 🧠 Focused on **active learning**, not memorization

## 📚 Current Coverage

  Based on the *Mirantis DCA Study Guide (2025)*

Future extensions may include:

- ☸️ **Kubernetes Certifications (CKA / CKAD / CKS)**

## 🎯 Objective
